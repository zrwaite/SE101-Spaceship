		 * Scanning Algorithm:
		 * First, split the map into smaller regions
		 * Then, utilizing any path algorithm, find the optimal path to leave the region
		 * and move onto the next region
		 * 	Also, check adjacent regions for:
		 * 		What objects are located in the regions beside them, and base the heading of the ship
		 * 		based on this information
		 * 		Also mark each region as travelled to unsure that the ship is not heading into the 
		 * 		same region
		 * 
		 * Repeat this algorithm until a warp gate or a planet is found
